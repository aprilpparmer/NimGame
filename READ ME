6/16/14: When creating testing classes, I assumed that I should not create a testing package for
	AbstractPlayer, since an abstract class cannot be instantiated. Also, because all of the methods
	will be tested in the HumanPlayer and ComputerPlayer testing classes.
	
	I did not test the creation of a computer player or the getName method, because there is only one outcome due to the
	final variable.
	
	For ComputerPlayer: I included testing the no parameter version of setNumberSticksToTake() in the same testing
	class as the parameter version.
